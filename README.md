## What is it?
Imhotep is a tool which will comment on commits coming into your
repository and check for syntactic errors and general lint
warnings. 

## Installation

Currently, installation is done from source through Python packaging
system. We first need to download it from GitHub. We then setup a
virtualenv which will keep our python packages separate from other
things on your system, lest we have version conflicts. Finally, we
install the required packages.

```
git clone git://github.com/justinabrahms/imhotep.git
virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use imhotep, we must tell it which repository to look at, who to
authenticate as and what to comment on. Imhotep is able to comment in
two ways: either on a single commit or on a pull request.


### Commenting on a pull request
```
python imhotep.py \
       --repo_name="justinabrahms/imhotep" \
       --github-username="your_username" \
       --github-password="a_sha_generated_by_github" \
       --pr-number=1
```

### Commenting on a single commit
```
python imhotep.py \
       --repo_name="justinabrahms/imhotep" \
       --github-username="your_username" \
       --github-password="a_sha_generated_by_github" \
       --commit="a123445714cfa89d1e843d9950ea8f249cd6e4df"
```

### Where do I get that SHA?

The SHA generated by github is done through your user's [settings
page](https://github.com/settings/applications). Generate a personal
access token and use that for the `--github-password` above.

## Linter Support

There is currently support for 2 linters: PyLint and JSHint. If it
finds violations, it will post those violations to GitHub. New linting
tools are encouraged!

## What's with the name?

Imhotep, the first Egyptian architect, is known as "the one who comes
in peace". In keeping with that name, the goal of this tool is to keep
code reviews peaceful and productive by having robots point out the
nitpicky details, leaving people to critique bigger picture things,
not spacing and misspelling issues.
