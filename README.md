## What is it?
Imhotep is a tool which will comment on commits coming into your
repository and check for syntactic errors and general lint
warnings.

**NOTE**: This repository has been archived, as it's been superceeded by GitHub's [check annotations](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks#checks) feature.

## Installation

Currently, installation is done from source through Python packaging
system. We first need to download it from GitHub. We then setup a
virtualenv which will keep our python packages separate from other
things on your system, lest we have version conflicts. Finally, we
install the required packages.

```bash
virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install imhotep
```

If you want to hack on imhotep, that looks more like this:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/justinabrahms/imhotep.git
cd imhotep
virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

You'll also need to install the plugins you'd like to run. Examples
include [jshint](https://github.com/justinabrahms/imhotep_jshint),
[flake8](https://github.com/glogiotatidis/imhotep_flake8),
[pep8](https://github.com/justinabrahms/imhotep_pep8),
[pylint](https://github.com/justinabrahms/imhotep_pylint),
[rubocop](https://github.com/scottjab/imhotep_rubocop),
[foodcritic](https://github.com/scottjab/imhotep_foodcritic),
[PMD](https://github.com/tslmy/imhotep_pmd),
and [jsl](https://github.com/mghayes/imhotep_jsl). You can
install those with pip. Example: `pip install imhotep_jshint`.

## Usage

To use imhotep, we must tell it which repository to look at, who to
authenticate as and what to comment on. Imhotep is able to comment in
two ways: either on a single commit or on a pull request.


### Commenting on a pull request
```bash
    imhotep \
       --repo_name="justinabrahms/imhotep" \
       --github-username="your_username" \
       --github-password="a_sha_generated_by_github" \
       --pr-number=1
```

### Commenting on a single commit
```bash
    imhotep \
       --repo_name="justinabrahms/imhotep" \
       --github-username="your_username" \
       --github-password="a_sha_generated_by_github" \
       --commit="a123445714cfa89d1e843d9950ea8f249cd6e4df"
```

### Where do I get that SHA?

The SHA generated by github is done through your user's [settings
page](https://github.com/settings/applications). Generate a personal
access token and use that for the `--github-password` above.

                        Github password for the above user.
  --no-post             [DEBUG] will print out comments rather than posting to github.
  --authenticated       Indicates the repository requires authentication
  --pr-number PR_NUMBER
                        Number of the pull request to comment on
  --cache-directory CACHE_DIRECTORY
                        Path to directory to cache the repository
  --linter LINTER [LINTER ...]
                        Path to linters to run, e.g. 'imhotep.tools:PyLint'
  --shallow             Performs a shallow clone of the repo
  --github-domain GITHUB_DOMAIN
                        You can provide an alternative domain, if you're using github enterprise, for instance
  --report-file-violations
                        Report file-level violations, i.e. those not on individual lines
  --dir-override DIR_OVERRIDE
                        Override the full path to the local repository.
```

Note: if you get a error where the plugin cannot find `imhotep.tools`, make
sure you installed imhotep into your virtualenv with `pip install -e .`. See
the [Installation](#installation) instructions above.

## Linter Support

If it finds violations, it will post those violations to GitHub. New linting
tools are encouraged!

By default, imhotep runs all plugins it can find on your source
code. If you'd like to only run a subset of linters, you should
specify the `--linter` directive with a dotted path to the module. An
example of this is `imhotep.tools:PyLint` or
`imhotep_pep8.plugin:Pep8Linter`. If you want to specify multiple
tools, just pass multiple things to the `--linter` flag.

## Writing Plugins

Imhotep supports adding linters through a plugin API based around
Python's setuptools entrypoints. This means that plugins can live as
separate Python packages which are installable alongside imhotep.

To write your own tool, subclass [the Tool
class](https://github.com/justinabrahms/imhotep/blob/master/imhotep/tools.py)
and override the `process_line`, `get_file_extensions`, and
`get_command` methods. If you need greater control over how the tool
is run, you can override the `invoke` method which gives you maximal
control over how the tools are run.

To make your plugin discoverable, you need to add an `entry_points`
stanza to your `setup.py`. It looks like this.

```python
setup(
    # ...
    entry_points={"imhotep_linter": [".py = path.to.module:ToolClassName"]}
    # ...
)
```

The key pieces of this are the name of the entrypoint which **must**
be `imhotep_linter`. This is how we know where to find the
plugins. The list that follows it is a list of strings that map file
extensions to a tool that knows how to lint them. So for the entry
above, we'll do something like `from path.to.module import
ToolClassName` and run that on all `.py` files in the repository.

You can find a working example of a `setup.py` file in the
[imhotep_pep8
repository](https://github.com/justinabrahms/imhotep_pep8/blob/master/setup.py).

## What's with the name?

Imhotep, the first Egyptian architect, is known as "the one who comes
in peace". In keeping with that name, the goal of this tool is to keep
code reviews peaceful and productive by having robots point out the
nitpicky details, leaving people to critique bigger picture things,
not spacing and misspelling issues.


# Release Notes

### 3.0.0
Backwards incompatible change:
- Dropped support for Python < 3.9 and pypy.

### 1.1.1

Bugfixes:
- Improved discovery of build tools

### 1.1.0

This is the first release where I'm tracking release notes. This
release is majoritively the work of danpalmer. Thanks, Dan!

Features:
- Support for file level violations

Backwards incompatible change:
- The printer reporter was broken, not using the correct interface for
  reporting individual lines. I've chosen to not bump the major
  version, because this change was to get something to work. Any work
  built on top of this class would have not be operational code, so
  I'm not worried about breaking someone.

Bugfixes:
- Different reporters that report errors on the same line don't
  clobber each other.
- File extensions are properly filtered before reporting.
